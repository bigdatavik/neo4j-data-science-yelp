    "This 4-part series covers data science concepts and techniques applicable to various domains and industries. Through practical examples, we will show just how easy it is to derive insights given a particular dataset. Thanks to Yelp, we have access to business, review and user data across multiple cities.  Using Neo4j to model and store our highly connected data, we will make sense of it, using a combination of Cypher, graph-specific algorithms and standard Python machine learning libraries.  Below are the topics that we will cover in this course:\n",

    "This course assumes that you have basic knowledge of the Cypher query language and some scripting in Python. For those not yet familiar with Cypher but have some experience with SQL, you will quickly discover that Cypher is just SQL for graphs! To help you get started, or simply brush up, please click [here](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-refcard/current/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Python to demonstrate traditional, non-graph specific data science techniques and algorithms.  While other languages have equally rich data manipulation and machine learning libraries, we have chosen Python for this course for its relatively low learning curve.  It is also a general purpose language, as opposed to statistics-focused, and has great emphasis on code readability. For Python resources, please click [here](https://www.python.org/doc/).\n",
    " \n",
    "One of the key concepts in the field of data science is the idea of reproducibility.  This means that we want our analysis to be performed so that it is well-documented and can easily be re-executed if needed.  For this, we use Jupyter Notebook which allows us to combine Python code, output, visualization and text all in one place!  To learn more about the notebook, please click [here](http://jupyter.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data required for this course has been pre-loaded into Neo4j. However, if you are interested in getting hands-on experience in creating your own Neo4j database, please follow instructions [here](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-data-science-yelp/blob/master/notebooks/neo4j_yelp_00_data_load.ipynb)."

    "The first thing we need to do when given a dataset is explore it. This allows us to understand the population that we are working with, as well as the quality of the data at hand.  Simple descriptive statistics like counts, averages and percentages help us gain insight into the various dimensions present in the data. In addition, visualizing distributions is useful in discerning values that are considered normal from those deemed to be extreme. In statistics, extreme values are commonly referred to as \"outliers\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In the data science pipeline, it is at the exploratory stage that we often discover that data is hardly ever clean or perfect. This means that we will come across dimensions or variables that either have missing, incorrect or extreme values.  Although it is beyond the scope of this course, it is worth noting that as data scientists, we learn to make adjustments and be creative in order to make the data more feasible to work with.  Examples of common techniques include applying transformation functions to variables, imputing missing values and deriving new variables from existing ones.\n",

Median is also referred to as the 50th percentile, labelled in the output above as `50%`.

Since we are only interested in categories associated with `Restaurants`, we choose not to display `Restaurants` as part of our result set.  This is done by adding an additional statement in the `WHERE` clause such that `c.name <> 'Restaurants'`.  \n",

The table above shows that of these restaurants, 1478/7148 or 21% are also tagged as being in category `Food`.  Perhaps this is not the most interesting insight, but if we look down the list, we do see variety in categories associated with restaurants in Toronto.  Of particular interest is the `Breakfast & Brunch` category as it has been a trend in Toronto for quite some time and continues to be popular.  This leads us to our final practice exercise."
